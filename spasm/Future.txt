New Instructions:
    XOR -- VAL ^= PTR
    ARCH -- Detect 32 v 64 bit arch
        xor eax, eax
        db 0x40
        ret eax  -> if 0 then 64 bit \\ if 1 then 32 bit
    
Stack Frames for call / return convention

MAKE SURE THAT EGET RETURNS BOTH VALUE AND ADDRESS IN VAL AND PTR
    VAL = RAX
    PTR = &RAX

Relative jumps (though this is going to be very hard to judge w/ macros)
    probably useful for compiler

    jumps relative to label
