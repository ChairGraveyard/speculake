\section{Application Payloads}

While the amount of computation done in a single speculative execution is small,
we demonstrate several applications that can take advantage of multiple
speculative runs to carry out computation.

As a first step, we observe that this primitive can be used to trivially
implement a finite state machine: any logic can be done in the speculative
world, while
updates to the state are communicated to the real world where they are stored.
On the next run of the speculative instructions, they read from the real world
state (and other inputs), compute any state transitions, and communicate the
result. In this mode, the state is maintained by the real world, while updates
are controlled by code executed speculatively.

        process when triggered. \textit{Speculative Computation} has access
        to all variables which do not require a memory transaction within
        the current state of the process. The process can subsequently make
        \textit{Resultant Computations} based on the value returned from 
        Prime and Probe to update the state of the process. }

\subsection{Virtual Machines}
Given the specific constraints that the speculative environment enforces on these 
paylods, general purpose compuatation []. We demonstrated in section~\ref{subsec:turing} that 
general purpose computation is possible using computation performed in the 
speculative environment. However, a turing machine is not a user friendly model,
nor is it an efficient model for computation when attempting to accomplish tasks
on modern processors. 

Using emulators in the "real world" allows for crafted binary programs to be 
instrumented in dead code and, as demonstrated in secton~\ref{subsec:decryption} 
encrypted and hidden. This gives an advantage to attackers as traditional 
reverse engineering methods will reveal only that emulation is being done. 
It reveals nothing about the ultimate goal of the program. 

To accomodate both developers as well as the unique constraints 
enforced by the speculative primitive, a custom emulation solution is required. We 
have approached this challenge from both directions. First we demonstrate 
general purpose emulation using a custom instruction set -- SPASM -- which
accomodates the speculative primitive specifically. Next we investigate custom 
wrappers on traditional emulators allow for similar payload construction,
with a much more developer friendly
